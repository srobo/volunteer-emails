Hi,

I'm writing to you on behalf of [Student Robotics][srobo], a nationwide charity that promotes STEM through an annual robotics competition for teams of 16-18 year olds.

We're entirely volunteer run and were wondering if any your societies members might be interested in becoming SR volunteers.

# What is Student Robotics

Student Robotics was founded in 2006 by a group of students at Southampton University and has since run 12 competitions with the SR2019 having 37 teams in total, from around the UK and one from Germany.

Teams of students are given some robotics kits and the rules of a game at a 'Kickstart' event and over 6 months they must build, test and refine their fully autonomous robot before competing in a two-day competition.

# What does volunteering look like? (Mentor, plan, help competition etc.)

Volunteering for Student Robotis can involve a wide variety of tasks from events organisation, to kit development, to mentoring students, to just turning up to be a pair of hands at the events. Our volunteers are able to spend as much or as little time doing SR tasks as they wish.

# How to join (volunteer link on the website (does that send out welcome introducing to Slack + GitHub?))
