Hi,

As you may be aware, Student Robotics returned for SR2019. Following that, we're
trying to ensure that our records are up to date.

You're receiving this email because our inventory system [1] records that you
hold some (possibly historic) equipment. Please could you have a look in the
inventory (the top level folders for people are named as first initial and
surname) and check whether you still have the items it records.

Don't worry if you no longer have the items; we appreciate that it may have been
several years since you were involved in Student Robotics.

Whether or not you still have the items, please let us know so that we can
update our records. We'll then let you know what to do with any items you still
have.

Thanks,
Peter
