Thanks so much for volunteering at the competition! We're always looking to improve, so it would really help us a lot if you could leave us some feedback.

We would really appreciate if you would **[fill out our Volunteer Feedback Survey here](https://forms.gle/MvzoqyBDKJNHefaD9)**.

In addition, if you'd like to provide more feedback on certain aspects of how the competition went, either points on the entire year, or the event itself. We're collecting feedback, which we'll collate and discuss in a future meeting. Feel free to submit the form as many times as you'd like, try to separate multpile points in separate responses.

Thanks!
