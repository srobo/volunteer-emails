Thanks so much for volunteering at SR2024! We're always looking to improve, so it would really help us a lot if you could leave us some feedback.

We would really appreciate it if you would **[fill out our Volunteer Feedback Survey here](https://forms.gle/MvzoqyBDKJNHefaD9)**.

In addition, if you'd like to provide more specific feedback on more general aspects of how the competition went, we're collecting feedback points which we'll collate and discuss in a future meeting. These can be about the event itself, or the entire year. Feel free to submit the form as many times as you'd like, but do try to separate multiple points into separate responses.

**Optionally [Add your feedback points here](https://forms.gle/fgxgsWpycZX8ijgs9)**.

Thanks!
