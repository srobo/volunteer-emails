Hi Everyone, 

We've opened volunteer sign-ups for the competition weekend of SR2024!

The competition will take place at the University of Southampton on April 13th & 14th, with optional set-up days on the 11th & 12th. We'd love it if you could volunteer any time you can to help things run smoothly!

Teams have been diligently building their robots for 6 months to match their wits against other teams at this grand finale, - and we need **you** to make it happen! 

We try hard to make this event as exciting as possible. Not only for the competitors, but also the volunteers, too. We'll ensure you have a fulfilling and memorable weekend, without causing too much stress. 

Please share this sign-up form with all of your friends and family. The more people we have sign up, the smoother it will run.

If you're interested in attending, please sign up with the link below:

We'll put more details on the [event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2024/competition/) as they become available.

### Travel & Accommodation reimbursements

This is a 2-day event, and we understand a lot of you won't necessarily live near the venue. So we've put together a small budget to help reimburse you with your travel and accommodation expenses.

We're looking for sponsors to help increase this budget next year, if you know any company that might be willing to sponsor us, please get in touch!

There's also an opportunity to co-ordinate sharing accommodation with other volunteers to help keep expenses down. More details are available in the sign-up form.
