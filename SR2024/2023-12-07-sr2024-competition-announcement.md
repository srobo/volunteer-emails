Hi,

We're pleased to announce the venue and date for the main competition of SR2024.

The [competition][event] will take place over the weekend of 13th and 14th April
2024 at the University of Southampton.

This two-day event represents the culmination of the teams' work over the past
six months and is an exciting celebration of robot abilities.

The event takes a small army of people to run, both in planning over the next
five months and on the weekend itself. To get involved please join the
[`#competition-team`][slack-competition-team] in [Slack][slack-sign-up], or keep
an eye out for the event sign-up form later in the year.
