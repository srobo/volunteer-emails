Hi All,

Student Robotics 2024 was [Kickstarted][launch-blog] on Saturday 21st October on our [livestream][livestream]. 30 teams from around the UK and Europe joined us as we introduced competitors to the competition, our kits, and this yearâ€™s [game][game-rules]!

## Key Dates / Programme Structure

Our experiment with adding challenges and a virtual element to the physical competition last year were both successes, so we're building on what we've learnt and will continue to have challenges and a virtual competition in addition to the usual physical competition.

We've pencilled in some key dates for the year with some of the key ones listed below. Be sure to check out the SR shared calendar for all the planned dates including Tech Days and prep events.

- 2023-10-21 [Kickstart](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2024/virtual-kickstart/)
- 2024-03-09 [Virtual competition](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2024/virtual-competition/)
- 2024-04-13 â€“ 2024-04-14 Competition (provisional)

As usual there are a variety of Tech Days running throughout the year, be sure to check the [events page][events-page] on the website for details.

## Get involved

There's loads of ways to help with SR2024, taking as much or as little time as you can give.

- The physical competition needs a small army of volunteers to run in numerous technical and non technical roles. We'll open sign ups for volunteering at the event as soon as we can confirm the venue later in the year
- Throughout the year there's lots of preparation to do for the competition and other events, with tasks big & small where any help is welcome. Once again this year the competition planning has been broken down into areas: Health & Safety, Mentoring, Teams, Event logistics, Livestreaming, Production, the Game, Volunteering and the Simulator
- We're on the look out for mentors, who would regularly attend a teams' meetings (either virtually on in person) and assist them. If you're interested, please sign up to [mentor a team][mentor-signup]
- We'll be running Tech Days and in person events which will need people to help run

Keep an eye on your inboxes for information about these opportunities as details are announced!
