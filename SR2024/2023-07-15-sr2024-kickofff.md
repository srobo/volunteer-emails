
Hi All,


Planning for SR2024 is underway! We're still in the early stages so this is the perfect time for you to get more involved.

## Key Dates / Programme Structure

Our experiment with adding a virtual element to the physical competition last year was a success, so we're building on what we've learnt and will continue to have both a physical and virtual competition.

We've pencilled in some key dates for the year with some of the key ones listed below. Be sure to check out the SR shared calendar for all the planned dates including Tech Days and prep events.

- 2023-10-21 Kickstart
- 2024-02-10 Virtual competition (provisional)
- 2024-03-23 â€“ 2024-03-24 Competition (provisional)

## Get involved

There's loads of ways to help with SR2024, taking as much or as little time as you can give.

- The physical competition needs a small army of volunteers to run in numerous technical and non technical roles. We'll open sign ups for volunteering at the event as soon as we can confirm the venue ???
- We're on the look out for mentors, who would regularly attend a teams' meetings (either virtually on in person) and assist them
- We'll be running Tech Days and in person events which will need people to help run

Keep an eye on your inboxes for information about these opportunities as details are announced!
