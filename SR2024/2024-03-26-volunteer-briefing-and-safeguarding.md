Hello!

Thanks for signing up to volunteer at Student Robotics 2024.

The competition is just 2 weeks away (April 13th-14th), it has come so fast!

Below are some important updates you need to know before the event.

## Your Roles
We're finalizing your volunteer roles for the competition. You should receive a schedule this weekend along with descriptions for each task you'll personally be doing.

**If you can no longer attend the competition, please email me ASAP so I can reassign your roles!**

## Briefing Call
In preparation for the competition, we'll be hosting a **volunteer briefing call** next weekend **at 8pm UK Time on Saturday the 6th** on this link:

 <!--meet link censored -->

In this call, we'll give you a quick intro to the event; the event layout, how it runs, who to speak to, and we'll field any questions you may have.

If you can't come to the briefing call, that's okay! The email you receive this weekend should have sufficient details on what your assigned roles are and how to perform them. If you have any questions, shoot me an email!

## Safeguarding
It's **required** for **all volunteers** to read our Safeguarding policy, **even if you've read it last year** before you are permitted to act as a volunteer for Student Robotics 2024.

You must read it using the link below, and then confirm to us by sending an email to:  [safeguarding@studentrobotics.org](mailto:safeguarding@studentrobotics.org?subject=Safeguarding%20confirmation&body=I%2C%20YOURNAMEHERE%0A%0Acan%20confirm%20I%20have%20read%20the%20safeguarding%20policy.)

> I, YOURNAMEHERE, have read the safeguarding policy.

The safeguarding policy is here: https://opsmanual.studentrobotics.org/about-the-charity/safeguarding

We'll let you know who the safeguarding officer is (among other things) in the morning briefing on both competition days.

Thanks and see you at the competition in 2 weeks!
