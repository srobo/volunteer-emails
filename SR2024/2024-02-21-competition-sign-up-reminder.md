Hi all,

Sign-ups are still open to volunteer at the competition!

The event will take place on April 13th - 14th (with set-up days on the 11th and 12th) at the University of Southampton Students Union. 

In addition to free t-shirts, we have a small budget for you to put towards travel and accommodation, and weâ€™ll provide lunch on the competition days. 

We cannot provide accommodation for the competition, however we can help you to organise with each other to share hotel/AirBnB bookings. If you indicate on the form, we'll add your details to the self-organisation sheet, and hopefully you'll find a match.

If you'd like to volunteer, please sign up below:

[**SIGN UP HERE**](https://forms.gle/BS8MAkyhjMvZTv2B8)

There'll be plenty of support for you at the event; including briefings at the start of each day, and people assigned to take care of you during the event.

Thanks,
-- The Student Robotics Competition Team
