Hi all,

Sign-ups are still open to volunteer at the competition!

The event will take place on April 13th - 14th (with set-up days on the 11th and 12th) at the University of Southampton Students Union. 

In addition to free t-shirts, we have a small budget for you to put towards travel and accommodation, and weâ€™ll provide lunch on the competition days. 

We cannot provide accommodation for the competition, however we can help you to organise with each other to share hotel/AirBnB bookings. If you indicate on the form, we'll add your details to the self-organisation sheet, and hopefully you'll find a match.

If you'd like to volunteer, please sign up below:

[**SIGN UP HERE**](https://forms.gle/BS8MAkyhjMvZTv2B8)

While signing up, you'll be able to express your preferences on which roles you're interested in. A healthy sample of these are:

- Guiding competitors around
- Commentating/running the livestream
- Marshalling matches
- Running reception
- Helping teams with their technical issues
- Running the photo booth
- Ferrying batteries around

Once you've signed up, you'll be emailed your volunteering schedule closer to the date, along with detailed instructions on how to carry out your roles.

There'll be plenty of support for you at the event; including briefings at the start of each day, and people assigned to take care of you during the event.

Thanks,
-- The Student Robotics Competition Team
