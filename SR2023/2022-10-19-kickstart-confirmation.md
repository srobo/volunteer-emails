Hi,

Thank you so much for volunteering to help at Kickstart SR2023! We're excited for Kickstart to be back in person and couldn't do it without your help.

When you arrive at the University (hopefully by 9:30) make your way to Building 46 (South-West corner), where you should see some other volunteers in our distinctive blue shirts. If you have any issues on the morning you can call 07732300377 and James will do his best to help.

The day will consist of a presentation to students where the game will be announced, kits will be handed out, and then the teams will complete some Microgames. Microgames are small tasks for the competitors to complete that should help familiarise them with their kits.

Throughout the day you will be expected to help competitors with any issues they have and to help with moving kits and other equipment between buildings. 

If this is your first SR event as a volunteer there's nothing to worry about it! We'll make sure you have a veteran volunteer to go to with any issues and Kickstarts are generally fairly relaxed events so it should be a great chance for you to dip your toes into the water.

If you have any questions prior to Saturday please do just get in touch!
