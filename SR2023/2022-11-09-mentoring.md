Hi All,

We're looking for mentors!

Mentoring is an opportunity for you to get to know a team and to grow your communication and teamworking skills, as well as help them improve their robot.

Your role as a mentor is to guide the team towards good solutions for their robot, provide assistance where they might need it as well as help them understand the simulator, the rules and the competition as a whole. This doesn’t mean that you need to know everything about these yourself (it’s completely fine not to know things!), rather you will guide them towards finding the information for themselves.

We have some [guidance for mentors](https://studentrobotics.org/runbook/volunteering/mentor-guidance/) in our runbook which we encourage all potential mentors to read, and we will support you through the year.

The time commitment for mentoring varies by team, though it is typical to spend a few hours every week or fortnight on a mentoring session. We offer teams the option of in-person or remote mentoring (via video call).

If you're interested in becoming a mentor then [sign up now](https://forms.gle/WvL9vgrAPm4oPxbX6)!
