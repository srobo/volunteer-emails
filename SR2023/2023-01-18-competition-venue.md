Hello,

# Competition Event

We're thrilled to announce the venue for Student Robotics 2023 -- it will be
held in person at Southampton University on the weekend 1st April.

We're in the early stages of planning the event and would like to hear from
anyone who would be interested in volunteering at the event and/or during setup
days. If you're not sure if you'll be around, but might be interested we'd still
like to hear from you; we'll be following up to confirm more details and roles
nearer the time and after we have a sense of the number of volunteers available.

Please note that we are not able to reimburse travel or accommodation at the
competition, though we hope to provide ways for volunteers who are interested to
group together to save costs.

We're also looking for people to help organise the competition. Even if you only
have a small amount of time available, every contribution helps make the event
better for the competitors. If you'd like to help, please come along to a
competition meeting or contact <competiton-team@studentrobotics.org>.

We will put more details on [the event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/competition/) as they become available.

## Tech Days

We also have some upcoming Tech Days - an opportunity for teams to spend a whole
day working on their robot with lots of help available. They also provide an
opportunity to see how the teams are progressing and ensure they get the most
out of their experience in Student Robotics.

As a volunteer they're great opportunities for you to see how the teams are
doing and gain experience both with the kits and with supporting teams, while
being supported by other volunteers. No prior experience is needed.

If you could be available and would like to help at one of the in-person or
virtual Tech Days we're planning please fill in this form to let us know where
and when you're available:
