Hi,

Student Robotics 2023 is ongoing, and we've been running monthly tech days for us to give in-person mentoring to teams.

As a volunteer they're great opportunities for you to see how the teams are doing and gain experience both with the kits and with supporting teams, while being supported by other volunteers. Don't worry if you don't have any experience, there will be other volunteers happy to help you learn!

Our tech-day dates are as follows:

- **This Weekend** [7th January Virtually on Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/virtual-tech-day-january/).
- [4th February 2023 in Horsham](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/horsham-tech-day-february/).
- 4th February 2023 in Southampton (Unconfirmed, not yet announced).
- 11th March 2023, Location TBD.

The next tech day is a virtual tech day this Saturday on Discord, if you sign up for this we'll try to contact you but because it's so soon, you can [join our slack](https://goo.gl/forms/Maq41MHF8CYSRVn83) and pay attention to #events for live information!

If you're available and would like to help at one of the in-person Tech Days we're planning, please fill in the form below to let us know when and where you're available:
