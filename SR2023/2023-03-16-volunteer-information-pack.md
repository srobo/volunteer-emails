Hi all,

Firstly we're so thankful that you signed up to volunteer at Student Robotics 2023! I'm Andy, I'll be in charge of managing volunteering for the competition. If you have any questions, or have updates about your availability, please send me an email ASAP!

The competition is just round the corner, so I thought I'd share more detailed information about the event.

# Slack
Before you read any further, we'd recommend you [make sure you are signed up to our Slack chat room](https://goo.gl/forms/Maq41MHF8CYSRVn83). We usually use Slack to communicate with volunteers during the competition itself.

# Safeguarding Policy
**All volunteers are required to read the [safeguarding policy](https://opsmanual.studentrobotics.org/about-the-charity/safeguarding)**. Please ensure you have read this ahead of time, and email safeguarding@studentrobotics.org to confirm you have read and understood it.

# Set-up days
We'll be having set-up days on the Thursday and Friday before the event, there is typically no set schedule for these days, just a list of tasks to get through. These lists are big though, we need all the help we can get to ensure everything is ready in time for the competition.

# Competition days
Please aim to arrive by 8:30am for both the Saturday and Sunday if you can. This is when we will brief everyone on the day. If you arrive late, please try to find me (Andy Barrett-Sprot) to catch you up, and explain your roles to you.

We're currently still pinning down the finalized schedules for volunteers during the competition. If you signed up a while ago, please make sure the responses you had on the form are still up-to-date (You should have received an email with an edit link when you initially signed up). Expect an email soon with your individual roles and how to perform them!

# Getting to the venue
Please check our external event page for how to get to the venue, and where to park: https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/competition/

Unfortunately, there will a few factors to consider when trying to get to the venue:

### Rail Strikes
There is a rail strike scheduled for the Thursday set-up day, and the Saturday of the competition. For both of these days, [South Western Railway will have reduced services between Southampton and London](https://www.southwesternrailway.com/plan-my-journey/industrial-action), there are many rail operators in the UK though. At time of writing, not all have published plans for the competition weekend, so please check your intended train services are still running closer to the date.

### Southampton Marathon on Sunday
The [Southampton Marathon](https://www.southamptonmarathon.co.uk/residents-info) is scheduled on the competition Sunday. As a result, there will be a number of road closures in the area, including on the university campus where the competition is held. Parking will also be limited. Keep an eye on the [competition event page on our website](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/competition/) see up-to-date information on how to reach the competition. 

Last year the U1C bus still operated between the 'Southampton Airport Parkway' train station and the university campus, but the operator has not yet published their Marathon plans, so we'll keep you posted.

# Reimbursements for Accommodation and Travel 
Sadly we aren't able to provide Accommodation for volunteers this year. However, we are able to reimburse up to Â£85 total or travel and accommodation. If you urgently need a reimbursement, you can claim reimbursement in our [reimbursement claim form](https://forms.gle/ATV3UeS9Sbd2ynhv8), and mark 'this reimbursement is urgent'.

## COVID Safety
We take COVID safety very seriously, We strongly recommend all volunteers test themselves before the event. Volunteers should also wear masks at all times, especially including set-up days as we cannot afford to lose a large number of volunteers during the event.

## Food during the weekend
We're planning on arranging for sandwiches and fruit and biscuits to be available during lunchtimes. If you indicated your dietary requirements during sign-ups so we'll do our best to accommodate for you. You should also have a long enough lunch break if you want to get something specific.

We'll be having a meal on the Saturday evening, typically we ask for volunteers to pay for their share of this. Details of this will be announced closer to the date. Typically on Sunday we finish later, at around 8pm, and so will likely order fast-food to the venue.
