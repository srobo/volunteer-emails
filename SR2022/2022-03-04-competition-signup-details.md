Hi,

As mentioned in a previous email, the [SR2022 Competition](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/competition/)
event will be on the weekend of the 23rd April, in person at Southampton University.

We need some enthusiastic volunteers to help inspire the younger generation, and keep
this event running as smooth as possible. If you think you're up for it, sign up now!
Also, please feel free to forward this email to all others you think can help out. The more, the merrier!

Thanks to everyone who expressed their interest in helping out earlier in the year,
the input gathered then has been useful in planning the competition. As we mentioned
at the time we're now collecting more detailed information about volunteering at the
event so even if you expressed interest already please do fill in this form to provide
those details.

We're also looking for people to help organise the competition. Even if you only
have a small amount of time available, every contribution helps make the event
better for the competitors. If you'd like to help, please come along to a
competition meeting or contact <competition-team@studentrobotics.org>.
