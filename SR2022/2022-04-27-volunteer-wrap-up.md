Thank you so much for volunteering at the competition. Without volunteers like you, we would never be able to run a competition as amazing as we did this year!

We've already received lots of positive comments from the teams who competed, they loved the atmosphere we created and the enthusiasm we injected into the event -- nice work!

We're always looking to improve; we'd love to hear your feedback, so we can make SR2023 even better! Please fill out [our feedback survey](SURVEY_LINK).
