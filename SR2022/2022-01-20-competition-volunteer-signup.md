Hi,

The SR2022 Competition event will be on the weekend of the 23rd April, in person
at Southampton University.

We're in the early stages of planning the event and would like to hear from
anyone who would be interested in volunteering at the event and/or during setup
days. If you're not sure if you'll be around, but might be interested we'd still
like to hear from you; we'll be following up to confirm more details and roles
nearer the time and after we have a sense of the number of volunteers available.

Please note that, unlike previous years, we are not able to reimburse travel or
accommodation at the competition, though we hope to provide ways for volunteers
who are interested to group together to save costs.

We're also looking for people to help organise the competition. Even if you only
have a small amount of time available, every contribution helps make the event
better for the competitors. If you'd like to help, please come along to a
competition meeting or contact <competition-team@studentrobotics.org>.
