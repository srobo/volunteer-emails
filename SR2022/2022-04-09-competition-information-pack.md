Hi,

Thank you for agreeing to help out at the SR2022 competition!

A few bits of information to be aware of:


## Venue opening times
During the weekend the venue doors will open to competitors at 09:00. There will be some briefings and some tasks that need doing ahead of this, and this is likely to be outdoors, so please arrive promptly for 08:30 and be prepared for the weather conditions.

## Volunteer schedule
We're in the process of assigning volunteers, we'll soon be sending you an email with your individual roles and how to perform them, keep an eye out for it!

## Media Consent
You will have to complete a [Media Consent form](https://studentrobotics.org/resources/sr2022/media-consent.pdf). If you are able to complete this ahead of time that will be appreciated. There will be a few spare media consent forms available.

## Reimbursements
If you have made any expenditures for the competition, please remember to claim your money back. Please speak to the Competition Team Committee about approving refunds.

Unfortunately we are unable to cover expenses for getting to the competition or for accommodation this year.

## Safeguarding
All volunteers are required to read the [safeguarding policy](https://opsmanual.studentrobotics.org/about-the-charity/safeguarding). Please ensure you have read this ahead of time, and e-mail safeguarding@studentrobotics.org to confirm you have read and understood it.

## Refreshments
Hot drinks, cold drinks, and snacks will be available throughout the competition and the setup days. If possible, please bring a re-usable mug to make your drinks in so we can limit waste.
You will need to provide your own lunch, it is recommended that you bring this with you at the beginning of the day.

## Southampton Marathon

On Sunday 24th April, a marathon event is being held in Southampton. As a result there will be a number of road closures in the area, including on the university campus. Parking will also be limited. Keep an eye on the [competition event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/competition/) on our website to see up-to-date information on how to reach the competition. There may be some time changes to account for this, and some restrictions on which car parks are available.

Please note that this also means that access to food sellers may be restricted, so please plan accordingly.

## T-Shirts
As always, t-shirts have been ordered for all volunteers. These will be available when you arrive on the Saturday.

## COVID Safety

Life is beginning to get back to normal, and this means we are finally able to do in person events again! However, we must recognise that some people still have to be cautious, to protect their own health or their friends or family. As such, we ask that everyone follows [our COVID policy](https://studentrobotics.org/covid-19/) to help ensure we all keep safe, whilst still having lots of fun with robots!

Please keep an eye on this as we get closer to the competition, as the content may change.

## Setup days
On the Thursday and Friday, the venue doors will open at 09:00. We will be meeting in the SUSU entrance at this time. If you are arriving later in the day, then you will most likely find someone in the Cube.
There are also some changes to the COVID policy for the setup days, if you are attending the setup days please speak to someone on arrival to check what is required. Please ensure you bring a face mask.


Further information on many of these points can be found on the [competition event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/competition/), so keep an eye on this for updates. We welcome questions, so please feel free to ask (either by replying to this email or in Slack) if you need clarification on anything!

Thanks for all your help! We look forward to seeing you at the competition!
