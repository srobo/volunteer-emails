Hi,

We've allocated your volunteer roles during the competition, however these roles aren't fixed. There's a chance we may need to make alterations in the days leading up to the competition, so be sure to check the links again closer to the date to make sure you're still scheduled for the same roles! I'll also try to email you when changes happen.

- [Thursday (set-up day)](REDACTED)
- [Friday (set-up day)](REDACTED)
- [Saturday](REDACTED)
- [Sunday](REDACTED)

We have [a description of all roles](REDACTED) including links to more documentation, to help out I've put the description of your roles below:

{Short personal text explaining what they are signed up for and copy/pasting the role descriptions for their role}.

If you have any questions on any of your assigned roles in any way, now's the time to speak out! Just reply to this email and I'll try to cater for your preferences. As I said, we're pretty tight on volunteers right now, so don't expect a miracle!
