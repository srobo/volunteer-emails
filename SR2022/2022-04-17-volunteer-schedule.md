Hi, 

We've allocated your volunteer roles during the competition, however as we get closer to the competition, we're likely to have to make alterations (we're a bit tight on volunteers this year!), so be sure to check the links again closer to the date to make sure you're still scheduled for the same roles.

- [Thursday (set-up day)](REDACTED)
- [Friday (set-up day)](REDACTED)
- [Saturday](REDACTED)
- [Sunday](REDACTED)

We have made [a summary of the roles](REDACTED), but I've included a description for your roles below:

{Short personal text explaining what they are signed up for and copy/pasting the role descriptions for their role}.

If you don't like, or have questions on any of your assigned roles in any way, now's the time to speak out! Just reply to this email and I'll try to cater for your preferences. As I said, we're pretty tight on volunteers right now, so don't expect a miracle!
